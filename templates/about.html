            <p><span style="color: #7B6CF6;">That Song</span> is a clone of Shazam, an application which can identify songs through lyrics and artists.</br>
            If you have a memory like me, you'll understand how frustrating it is when you recognise a song by listening <strong>BUT</strong>, your brain can't find the words the identify it.</p>
